<h1>EPICS pvaClientJava</h1>
<h2 class="nocount">Release 4.2 - 2016-07-18</h2>

<h2 class="nocount">Abstract</h2>

<p>pvaClient is a software library that provides to an EPICS client programmer, a friendly
client side programming interface to the data of an EPICS based control system. It is intended 
for such uses as rapid development of ad hoc programs by controls engineers, or to provide 
scientists a way to directly develop analytical applications.</p>

<p>Specifically, pvaClient provides a synchronous interface for pvAccess, which is the
software support for high speed controls network communications used in EPICS version 4.
pvAccess provides a callback based interface, which can be hard to use.
pvaClient provides an interface that does not require callbacks even for monitors.
</p>
<p>
pvaClientChannel provides many "convenience" methods to directly get and put 
scalar and scalarArray data types.
Additional methods provide access to the full features of pvAccess.
</p>
<p>
pvaClientMultiChannel provides access to data from multiple channels.
It can be used directly by a client or via pvaClientMultiDouble or pvaClientNTMultiChannel.
pvaClientMultiDouble allows the client to get and put data to multiple channels.
But each channel must have a value field that is a numeric scalar.
pvaClientNTMultiChannel allows the client to get and put data to multiple channels.
Each channel must have a value field.
The data for the channels is presented via normative type NTMultiChannel.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
pvaClientJava is one of the components of 
<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net">
EPICS Version 4
</a>
</p>
<p>This document is only a guide to help locate code and documentation related to pvDatabaseJava
</p>
<p>
It is intended for developers that want to use pvDatabaseJava.
</p>
<h2>Developer Guide</h2>
<p>A guide for developers is available at
<a
href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/informative/developerGuide/developerGuide.html">
developerGuide
</a>
</p>
<p>This guide discusses all the components that are part of an <b>EPICS V4</b> release.
Some understanding of the components and how they are related is necessary in order to
develop code that uses pvDatabaseJava.
In particular read everything related to pvaClient.
</p>
<p>The developerGuide discusses code in a way that applies to both Java and C++.
For the descriptions of the Java specific code consult the next section.
